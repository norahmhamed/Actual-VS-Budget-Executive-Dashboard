# Actual vs Budget Executive Dashboard

Hey! This is my *Actual vs Budget Dashboard* built in *Power BI Desktop*.  
The goal is to help quickly see how actual numbers compare to the budget and spot any differences.  

## What I did
- Cleaned and prepared the data
- Created *measures using DAX*
- Built *interactive dashboards* with cards, charts, and matrices
- Used *conditional formatting* to make insights clear

## Tools
- Power BI Desktop  
- DAX  
- Excel (for some data prep)

## How to use
1. Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.  
2. Explore the dashboards and visuals.  
3. Update the data if you want to test with your own numbers.
